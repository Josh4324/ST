## RecurraPay

Automate sending recurring payment on your favourite chain and across chains. <br/>

## Project Description

RecurraPay is a decentralized standing order system which addresses the evolving financial needs of blockchain users by providing autonomy, interoperability, and a secure, cost-effective means of managing recurring payments. This innovation contributes to the broader mission of blockchain technology, which is to decentralize and democratize financial services, giving users greater control over their financial affairs.</br></br>

This project leverages the power of Chainlink automation and Axelar's cross-chain capabilities to provide users with a versatile standing order system. With this solution, users can effortlessly create standing orders for native tokens such as MATIC, BNB, AVAX, within their chain and the Axelar USD token which can be sent to other chains.
</br></br>

## Key Features:

Customized Standing Orders: Users have the freedom to create standing orders according to their preferences. They can specify the start date, end date, and the desired payment interval.
</br></br>

Payment Flexibility: Users can seamlessly manage their standing orders. They have the option to edit, pause, restart, or delete their standing orders, offering complete control over their financial commitments.
</br></br>

By combining Chainlink's automation capabilities with Axelar's cross-chain functionality, this project simplifies recurring payments across different blockchain networks, providing users with a convenient and customizable solution for managing their financial commitments.
